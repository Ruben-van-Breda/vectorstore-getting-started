Answer: Dialogs in SIP represent a persistent, peer-to-peer relationship between two User Agents (UAs) maintained throughout a communication session. They are established through a series of transactions and are crucial for managing stateful interactions. Dialogs are identified through a combination of Call-ID, local tag, and remote tag. A dialog is initiated by the initial transaction (such as INVITE) and remains active until it is explicitly terminated by a BYE request or a timeout. Dialogs are essential for maintaining the context of ongoing communication, facilitating call tracking, and handling mid-call signaling.

1. request (such as INVITE, BYE, or REGISTER) and all responses related to that request. Lifecycle: A transaction starts with the request and concludes when the final response is received. State: Transactions progress through various states including calling, trying, proceeding, completed, and terminated. SIP Dialogs A SIP dialog represents a persistent, peer-to-peer relationship between two User Agents (UAs) maintained throughout a communication session. It is established through a series of transactions and is vital for managing stateful interactions. Components: Dialogs are formed by SIP transactions and are identified through a combination of Call-ID, local tag, and remote tag. Lifecycle: A dialog is initiated by the initial transaction (such as INVITE) and remains active until it is explicitly terminated by a BYE request or a timeout. Purpose: Dialogs are crucial for maintaining the context of ongoing communication, facilitating the tracking of calls, and handling mid-call
2. it is explicitly terminated by a BYE request or a timeout. Purpose: Dialogs are crucial for maintaining the context of ongoing communication, facilitating the tracking of calls, and handling mid-call signaling, such as re-INVITEs or UPDATEs. SIP Sessions A SIP session covers the entirety of the multimedia interaction between endpoints, which is established and regulated using SIP. This includes the transfer of actual data like voice, video, or messages, typically carried out using RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol). Components: Sessions are defined by the media exchanged between endpoints and are negotiated through SIP and SDP (Session Description Protocol). Lifecycle: Sessions are initiated by SIP dialogs (beginning with an INVITE transaction) and persist until a BYE request concludes the session. Purpose: The session encompasses the full media exchange, supporting real-time communications such as voice calls and video conferences. Key Differences Scope: Transactions: Handle discrete

This mechanism is responsible for ensuring the delivery of a particular message and its associated responses between two SIP entities. Components: A transaction includes the initial request (such as INVITE, BYE, or REGISTER) and all responses related to that request. Lifecycle: A transaction starts with the request and concludes when the final response is received. State:
