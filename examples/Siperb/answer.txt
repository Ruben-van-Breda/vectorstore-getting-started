The WebRTC to SIP Proxy is a feature that allows devices to connect to a PBX (Private Branch Exchange) through a SIP Proxy. This mode enables full provisioning with SIP credentials, proxy settings, and media configuration. It also supports SIP over WebRTC with SRTP (Secure Real-time Transport Protocol) support, SIP Trace, Latency & Register Logs for diagnostics and analytics, and built-in Media Transcoding for legacy PBXs. This mode is known for its advanced routing logic, including regex-based patterns, geographic rules, and failovers. It is the default mode for connecting devices to the PBX through the Siperb SIP Proxy.

Proxy Registration Mode (Default) With Proxy Registration, devices connect to your PBX through the Siperb SIP Proxy. This mode unlocks the full suite of features that Siperb is known for, including: Full provisioning with SIP credentials, proxy settings, and media configuration SIP over WebRTC with SRTP support SIP Trace, Latency & Register Logs for diagnostics and analytics Built-in Media Transcoding for legacy PBXs Mobile Push Notifications for low-power background operation Trade-offs : Device State Subscriptions not supported (SUBSCRIBE) No Presence Status (PUBLISH) WebSocket Registration Mode In WebSocket Registration, devices register directly with your Asterisk server over a secure WebSocket (WSS) connection, bypassing the Siperb proxy entirely. This is ideal for advanced deployments where you want full control of the SIP signaling. Full provisioning remains available
