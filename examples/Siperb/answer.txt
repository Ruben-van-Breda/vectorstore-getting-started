The two registration modes offered by SIPERB are Proxy Registration Mode and WebSocket Registration Mode. In Proxy Registration Mode, devices connect to the PBX through the SIP Proxy provided by SIPERB. This mode allows for full provisioning with SIP credentials, proxy settings, and media configuration. It also supports SIP over WebRTC with SRTP support, SIP Trace, Latency & Register Logs, built-in Media Transcoding, and Mobile Push Notifications. However, it does not support Device State Subscriptions or Presence Status Publishing. 

On the other hand, WebSocket Registration Mode allows devices to register directly with the Asterisk server over a secure WebSocket connection, bypassing the SIP Proxy. This mode is ideal for advanced deployments where full control of the SIP signaling is desired. Full provisioning is still available, but outbound call routing is managed by the user's own PBX, giving them full control and responsibility for call setup, SIP routing, and fallback behavior. WebSocket Registration Mode supports Device State Subscriptions and Presence Status Publishing, but does not include features like Media Transcoding and Push Notifications.
