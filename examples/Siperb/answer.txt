Feature Codes are short dial strings that map directly to built-in Siperb features, allowing for rapid access to things like hold music tests or media echo tools from your dial pad. They are evolving into a powerful way to interact with advanced system features. Feature Codes include a Code (starting with *), a Feature Action (defines the function), a Connection Name for identification, and an optional Weight for prioritizing duplicates. Free Feature Actions available now include Music On Hold, Music On Hold 1, Early Media Test, and Video Echo. More features are coming soon.
