We offer 3 ways to connect with us. We can connect to your PBX (UAS) via our outbound registrations, or your PBX (UAS) can connect to us via our inbound registrations.\n                                            This links us with you.\n                                            You are not limited by these connections.\n                                            You can make as many connections as you want.\n                                            You will probably want to make one connection per extension on your PBX that you want to use with WebRTC.\n                                            One of these connections can also be a TISP, like Twillio Elastic SIP Trunking.\n                                            You are also not limited to the number of devices you can register your client endpoint (UAC) with. Learn more about Connections We offer 3 WebRTC client formats; Web, Tablet, and Mobile We offer 3 WebRTC client formats; Web, Tablet, and Mobile.\n                                            While the Web format also works well on most tablets, it's a better experience to use the mobile app on the tablets and mobile devices so that you can make use of push notifications. \n                                            They are fully compatible and respond easily to the screen size changes.\n                                            The Mobile Application client is available on the Play and App store, and for the Web application you can install the PWA or simply access the web page with the help of a simple Browser Extension . \n                                            The extension is available for Safari (Mac), Firefox (Mac/Windows/Linux) and Chrome (Mac/Windows/Linux). Learn more about our WebRTC Client Call Media Transcoding Depending on your server support or configuration, you can select how the media will flow over your connections.\n                                            For example, if you have an older PBX that doesn't support WebRTC, you should choose Transcoding .\n                                            This will take the WebRTC media (Opus DTLS) and transcode it into something suitable for your PBX like G711.\n                                            This comes at the most cost, as media traverses our network.\n                                            It also will have the highest latency because of the extra hop.\n                                            We have many points of presence around the world, so you (or the system) can choose the lowest latency.\n                                            In this instance, signaling is still relayed to your server, so you can perform transfers, holds, park, and all the features you are used to within your PBX. Learn more about Transcoding End-to-end Encrypted If your systems are more up-to-date, and can create a DTLS stream, but you don't have WebSocket's active or configured, we can Proxy Relay the offer using UDP (via your connection).\n                                            As with full media relay, signaling is relayed with your server, but the media is end-to-end encrypted, meaning that we are not even in the media path.\n                                            This means the cost is less and the latency should be lower.\n                                            Media will flow directly from the client endpoint (UAC) to your server (UAS), so there may be some firewall changes to make.\n                                            We try to send and receive over the same port, but this may not always be possible - it will depend on your network.\n                                            If this doesn't work, you may have to use the full media option. Learn more about End-to-end Encryption Mobile Application Our mobile application is available from the Google Play and Apple App Stores. \n                                The mobile applications are designed to work with the strengths of the native mobile backends, but present a common UI so that it looks and works the same as the Web Application. Web Application The Wep Application is 100% PWA compatible so you can launch and run Siperb just like any regular application making it work well for Windows and MacOS. \n                                Siperb also runs perfectly fine in all major browsers, for example Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari.\n                                To sign up and try Siperb Now: Sign Up Now Just like the mobile applications can make use of native push notifications, the Web Application also supports push notifications, allowing you to be notified of incoming calls when the tab is closed, or even when the entire browser is closed. Browse Screenshots Browser Extension Siperb can be further enhanced by adding the Browser Extension, allowing you call control from any tab. The Browser Extension allows users to control calls while in another tab.\n                            This simple but effective extension to the browser is activated by clicking the icon, but the icon also changes colors to indicate status and even the call count.\n                            The main screen has your session status, and convenient links to activities like login.\n                            You will clearly see the registration status for your account.\n                            Media is still captured off the main tab running the phone, but other calling activities can to seen here. You can initiate audio and video calls from the main screen. If you tab over to the Calls tab, you can: List all active call lines. Switch lines between active call lines. Hold and unhold the line. Hang up any active line. The Browser Extension is available for the 4 major browsers: Frequently Asked Questions We often get the following questions. Q. Do I need my own Asterisk PBX?
