These logs are automatically saved and stored by our system, and can be retrieved from the Admin Control Panel in two primary ways: Outbound SIP Trace and Inbound SIP Trace . Outbound SIP Trace Outbound traces are generated when a user makes a call from their softphone to the outside world. To view an outbound SIP trace: Ensure the user\u2019s device is set to Proxy Registration Mode (this mode is required for SIP traces to be captured). Go to the Devices section in the Admin Control Panel . Select the device that made the call. Click the SIP Trace tab at the top of the page. This will show a list of all outbound calls made by that device, each with a corresponding SIP trace. Inbound SIP Trace Inbound traces are generated when a call comes into the platform via a Connection . To view an inbound SIP trace: Go to the Connections section in the Admin Control Panel . Select the Connection that received the call. Click the SIP Trace tab at the top of the page. You will see a list of all inbound calls that passed through this connection. Exploring a SIP Trace In either case (inbound or outbound), the SIP Trace tab will display a table of trace entries, each representing a call. Click the blue triangle icon on the left of any row to expand the full SIP trace for that call. SIP Tracce for an Outbound Call SIP Trace for an Inbound Call Within the expanded view, clicking on any individual line will show you the full SIP message including headers and body.
