These modes determine how your device connects to your SIP infrastructure, while still supporting full device provisioning in both cases \u2014 so your users always enjoy a seamless setup experience, no matter the mode. Proxy Registration Mode (Default) With Proxy Registration, devices connect to your PBX through the Siperb SIP Proxy. This mode unlocks the full suite of features that Siperb is known for, including: Full provisioning with SIP credentials, proxy settings, and media configuration SIP over WebRTC with SRTP support SIP Trace, Latency & Register Logs for diagnostics and analytics Built-in Media Transcoding for legacy PBXs Mobile Push Notifications for low-power background operation Trade-offs : Device State Subscriptions not supported (SUBSCRIBE) No Presence Status (PUBLISH) WebSocket Registration Mode In WebSocket Registration, devices register directly with your Asterisk server over a secure WebSocket (WSS) connection, bypassing the Siperb proxy entirely. This is ideal for advanced deployments where you want full control of the SIP signaling. Full provisioning remains available \u2014 your devices are still configured and managed through Siperb, just without using our proxy Direct WebSocket (WSS) connection to your own infrastructure Support for Device State Subscriptions (SUBSCRIBE) Presence Status Publishing (PUBLISH) Requirements : Your Asterisk server must support WebRTC over WSS A valid public FQDN and SSL certificate are required Trade-offs : No SIPS trace or Register logging No media transcoding support No push notifications \u2014 requires always-on connections Call Routing Differences How calls are routed depends on the mode you choose: Proxy Registration Mode Outbound call routing is fully managed by Siperb using the Connections system . This lets you define advanced routing logic \u2014 including regex-based patterns, geographic rules, and failovers \u2014 all from your Siperb dashboard. WebSocket Registration Mode Your device acts like a direct desk phone replacement . Outbound call routing is entirely managed by your own PBX , giving you full control \u2014 but also full responsibility \u2014 for call setup, SIP routing, and fallback behavior.
